# hmm-lib

## About

This library implements Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for time-inhomogeneous Markov processes. This means that, in contrast to many other HMM implementations, there can be different states and a different transition matrix at each time step.

This library provides an implementation of

The Viterbi algorithm, which computes the most likely sequence of states.
The forward-backward algorithm, which computes the probability of all state candidates given the entire sequence of observations. This process is also called smoothing.

## Setup
